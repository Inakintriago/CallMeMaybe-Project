# 📞 CallMeMaybe - Identifying Inefficient Operators

## 📝 Context
This project aims to analyze the performance of operators at the virtual telecommunications company **CallMeMaybe**, identifying those who are less efficient based on their performance in incoming and outgoing calls.  
Operators are considered inefficient if they exhibit:
- A **high percentage of missed incoming calls** (both internal and external).
- **Prolonged wait times** for incoming calls.
- **Low activity in outgoing calls**, when it is part of their responsibilities.

This analysis will help improve operational efficiency, optimize workload distribution, and enhance service quality.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**: For data analysis and visualizing key metrics.
- **SQL**: Merging and cleaning telecommunications data.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard with dynamic visualizations.

## 📈 Results Analysis
- **Missed Call Rate by Operator**:
  - Identification of operators with high percentages of unanswered calls.
- **Average Wait Times by Operator**:
  - Determining the relationship between long wait times and missed calls.
- **Number of Outgoing Calls by Operator**:
  - Comparison of operators and their productivity targets.
- **Impact of Call Type**:
  - Comparison between internal and external calls on operator efficiency.
- **Influence of Pricing Plans**:
  - Analyzing whether certain clients create more workload for operators.

## 📋 Conclusions
- Identifying less efficient operators allows for **optimizing personnel and redistributing workloads**.
- It is recommended to implement **targeted training** for underperforming operators.
- **Incentive or penalty systems** could improve productivity and reduce wait times.
- The findings can be used to **improve internal processes** and optimize customer service.
